# DBMS - MySQL
SQL Projects as I learn along the way

## Assignment 1 - DDL Commands

A School Database is created using the basic DDL Commands 

### Full Workflow as each step demonstrates a DDL command in action:

    Create the database and table.
    Insert sample data and display it using SELECT.
    Add the Contact column.
    Remove the Grade column.
    Rename the table to CLASSTEN.
    Delete all rows from the table using TRUNCATE.
    Remove the table entirely using DROP.


## Assignment 2 - DDL Constraints

A Sales Database is created using basic DDL Constrints such as PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL AND UNIQUE. Further manipulated/updated the database with DDL & DML commands such as INSERT, RENAME, UPDATE, ADD and  DROP etc.

### Summary of Commands:

    Created the database and table.
    Added a new column to the table.
    Renamed the table.
    Inserted 10 rows into the renamed table.
    Retrieved specific columns using SELECT command.
    Updated a specific row in the table.
    Dropped the table entirely from the database.


## Assignment 3 - DML Commands

A Organisation database is created in which a Managers table is created with specific constriants. Required data/records are then retrieved with different DML commands

### Summary of Commands : 
    Created the Managers table with constraints like PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, and CHECK.
    Inserted 10 rows with relevant data.
    Retrieved specific manager information using SELECT.
    Calculated annual income using expressions in the query.
    Filtered records using WHERE with conditions like !=, BETWEEN, and logical operators like AND.

    
## Assignment 4 - SQL Queries

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for creating, managing, and querying relational databases. It includes two tables: Country and Persons, which contain information about countries and individuals, respectively. The project showcases various SQL operations such as table creation, data insertion, and complex queries.

### Summary of Commands :

    Created Country database with 2 tables Country and Persons
    Inserted 10 rows of relevant data.
    Retrieve distinct records using the DISTINCT funtion.
    Used AS function to show alias names in the result.
    Logicl operators(AND, OR), Comparison operators(<,>,=), IN and BETWEEN operators and LIKE function were used to retrieve the required records from the table.

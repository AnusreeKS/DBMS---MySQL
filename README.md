# DBMS - MySQL
SQL Projects as I learn along the way

## Assignment 1 - DDL Commands

A School Database is created using the basic DDL Commands 

### Full Workflow as each step demonstrates a DDL command in action:

    Create the database and table.
    Insert sample data and display it using SELECT.
    Add the Contact column.
    Remove the Grade column.
    Rename the table to CLASSTEN.
    Delete all rows from the table using TRUNCATE.
    Remove the table entirely using DROP.


## Assignment 2 - DDL Constraints

A Sales Database is created using basic DDL Constrints such as PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL AND UNIQUE. Further manipulated/updated the database with DDL & DML commands such as INSERT, RENAME, UPDATE, ADD and  DROP etc.

### Summary of Commands:

    Created the database and table.
    Added a new column to the table.
    Renamed the table.
    Inserted 10 rows into the renamed table.
    Retrieved specific columns using SELECT command.
    Updated a specific row in the table.
    Dropped the table entirely from the database.


## Assignment 3 - DML Commands

A Organisation database is created in which a Managers table is created with specific constriants. Required data/records are then retrieved with different DML commands

### Summary of Commands : 
    Created the Managers table with constraints like PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, and CHECK.
    Inserted 10 rows with relevant data.
    Retrieved specific manager information using SELECT.
    Calculated annual income using expressions in the query.
    Filtered records using WHERE with conditions like !=, BETWEEN, and logical operators like AND.

    
## Assignment 4 - SQL Queries

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for creating, managing, and querying relational databases. It includes two tables: Country and Persons, which contain information about countries and individuals, respectively. The project showcases various SQL operations such as table creation, data insertion, and complex queries.

### Summary of Commands :

    Created Country database with 2 tables Country and Persons
    Inserted 10 rows of relevant data.
    Retrieve distinct records using the DISTINCT funtion.
    Used AS function to show alias names in the result.
    Logicl operators(AND, OR), Comparison operators(<,>,=), IN and BETWEEN operators and LIKE function were used to retrieve the required records from the table.

## Assigment 5 - Grouping and Sorting 

This project involves working with two related tables: Country and Persons. The project showcases various SQL operations, such as table creation, data insertion, along with GROUP BY and ORDER BY functions for grouping and sorting of the records.

### Summary of Commands

    Created Population database with 2 tables Country and Persons
    Inserted 15 rows of relevant data.
    Substring function was used to retrtieve a substring of specific length 
    Used AS function to show alias names in the result.
    Arithmetic functions such as MAX, MIN, COUNT,AVG etc were used to retirive the required records from the table.
    LIMIT function was used to limit the number of records returned from a query.
    GROUP BY function is used to group the records in the table according to the given condition.
    ORDER BY function was used to sort the result of the query.
    HAVING function is used filter the records in the table acoording to a givwen condition.
